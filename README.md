## How It's Made:
Tech used: Node.js, Express, REST architecture, MongoDB, Mongoose, JSON, Postman, Heroku

This project focused on developing database skills and creating an API to display data in a dynamic and visually appealing way. This project required the ability to develop authentication logic so users are able to securly login to the platform. 

## Optimizations
Expanding the movie database and implementing more features such as including movie trailors.

## Lessons Learned:
Routing HTTP requests using Express
Defining endpoints for an API
Creating a nonrelational database with MongoDB
Implementing authentication and authorization into an API with HTTP and JWT authentication
Implementing data security and storage controls
Hosting a project on the web
